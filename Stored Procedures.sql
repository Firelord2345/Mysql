-- First let's just write a super simple query

-- Now if we run this it will work and create the stored procedure
-- we can click refresh and see that it is there

-- notice it did not give us an output, that's because we 

-- If we want to call it and use it we can call it by saying:

-- if we tried to add another query to this stored procedure it wouldn't work. It's a separate query:

-- now we change the delimiter back after we use it to make it default again
